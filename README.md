Folder name should be titled "videos" (case-sensitive)

Within the folder, there should be the main.py code, and also subfolders with videos in them.
The videos must end in the tags ".mp4", ".webm", or ".ogg"

You can either search up video by folder, name, or both.

There is also a scroll function which lets you scroll through the videos one by one.
Wehn you watch the srolling videos, you can add annotation that will pop up in a csv file located in the "videos" dictionary.
